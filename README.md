# Multi Restaurant platform (a react native implementation)
The project has been developed based on my prior experience as a waiter on a local branch in Cali, Colombia. Is ment to allow workers to splitt orders by costumer's name because it's actually something pretty common and if you don't have a system to support yourself you that easy request by the costumer can give you a really hard time.
It has been developped just as an educational pourpose and is not ment to get me any income by this time
