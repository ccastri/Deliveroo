# Multi Restaurant platform (a react native implementation)
The project has been developed based on my prior experience as a waiter on a local branch in Cali, Colombia. Is ment to allow workers to splitt orders by costumer's name which is something pretty common on a waiter/waitress daily basis. So if they don't have a good system to support theirselves on easy requests by the costumer like this it can give them a really hard time and the costumer experience can be less engaging than expected.
It has been developped just as an educational pourpose and is not ment to get me any income by this time

Now that you've got interested let's try [downloading the apk](https://expo.dev/accounts/nocallerworld/projects/deliveroonew/builds/1fb2f8b0-33d4-4e1d-8cbb-5312ea47a72d) to locally install it on your android. Also, if you rather, try it directly from Expo:

## Android
### Anybody can try it

Now there are some pictures from the UI design implemented with react native:

-In this screen you can see the list of available restaurants in the app. There, you will see different rows showing restaurants following different criteria
(By this time everything is purely mocked. besides the cart logic to do the numbers on each bill either per person or in total:

Fot the restaurant screen you're going to see the available list of options from the menu on each restaurant listed on the rows at the main screen:
if you press on it once you should see the add/remove buttons and the item count
if you press it again everything has to dissapear
if you add some costumer's name you should see the count and the controls from it got duplicate. At the left there is the counter from the general check on the table (everybody's dishes will be accounted by this controls). at the right is going to be the controls for the particular costumer account (costumer in session) so he can set up his own splitted check far appart from the general table's check (His dishes will be counted in the general table as well on pourpose so the waiter can confirm
the total from the bill matches with the sum from each spefic costumer check

Those are the different modal screens the waiter and the costumers can see boths check by presing either the buttons

Finally this screen is just to indicate how longer the order may take to be delivered on the table

#Final thoughts
As I've stablished earlier I do have hands on experience dealing with the waiter's costumer service so I know pretty well how struggling can be keep splitting check for a big table during the rush hour in the place. For instance at lunch time, around noon time the employers from surrounding areas nearby restaurants are starving, looking for a something good to eat __*as fastest as possible*__ and when multiple bigg groupes come into the picture I can tell you it's going to be a caos on the kitchen so it's really important to get a fresh and cold mind to be in control of your zone and acknowledge the situation when dealing with some difficult clients 
so that you can earn some time by being emphatetic with them anddelivering the right food to the right costumer on every single case.
But still you have to keep track of every single person which is ordering on your zone, if you get distracted they can leave the place without paying for anything and you'll be charged on their behalf. Now imagine you have a table with 15 people and all of them are willing to get their own splitted check... Rember you're still having another costumers on the rest of the tables in your zone:
-are you able to leave them alone to take care of the big group needs?
-is that fare with the rest of the people in your zone since all of them are willing to get a good service while the witer is out of reach doing some math for the big
group?
-Is that even worth it? (Usually when they are splitting checks they are not willing to pay for the service but just for the food and drinks theirselves)
-Are you good in maths to do the right calculations and keep getting your mind cold to keep everything under control?

That's a brief example from the point of view from the inside of the restaurant when you go to eat something...
